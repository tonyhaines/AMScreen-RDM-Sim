# Overview of the AMScreen-RDM Application

## Purpose
The AMScreen-RDM application is a sample application designed to mimic the RDM Data Processing process. It demonstrates how to process data and send notifications using RabbitMQ. This application replaces the previous email-based notification system with a RabbitMQ-based messaging system.

## Key Features

### 1. Configuration Management
The application reads its configuration from a JSON file (`config.json`) located in the `AMScreen-RDM-config` directory. This configuration includes:
- RabbitMQ connection details (hostname, port, queue name, exchange name).
- Other necessary parameters for message formatting and sending.

### 2. Data Processing
The application processes input data from a file named `arrays.json`. This file contains arrays of information such as site codes, third-party CMS IDs, sign serial numbers, and other metadata required for message generation.

### 3. Message Generation and Sending
The application generates two types of messages:
- **RAISE Messages**: These are alert messages sent to indicate a specific condition or event.
- **CLEAR Messages**: These are sent to indicate that a previously raised condition has been resolved.

For each name and sensor state in the input data, the application sends five consecutive RAISE messages followed by one CLEAR message. Each message is formatted as a JSON string using the `JsonDataFormatter` class and sent to RabbitMQ using the `RabbitMQSender` class.

### 4. Integration with New Classes
New classes, such as `RabbitMQSender` and `JsonDataFormatter`, have been developed to facilitate the transition from email-based notifications to RabbitMQ-based messaging. These classes handle the formatting and sending of messages to RabbitMQ.

### 5. Updated RDMDPExRaiseFunc.cs
The `RDMDPExRaiseFunc.cs` file has been updated to demonstrate how to integrate the new classes (`RabbitMQSender` and `JsonDataFormatter`) into the application. This serves as a guide for developers looking to adopt the RabbitMQ-based messaging system in their own projects.

### 6. Error Handling
The application includes robust error handling to ensure that issues such as missing configuration values or invalid input data do not cause the application to crash. Errors are logged to the console for debugging and troubleshooting.

### 7. Delays Between Messages
To allow human observers to easily view the results on the Zoho Ticketing Desk, the application introduces a delay of 10 seconds between each message.

## Documentation
Detailed documentation for the AMScreen-RDM application is available in the `docs` folder. This includes HTML and LaTeX files generated by Doxygen, which provide an in-depth overview of the application's structure, classes, and functionality.
